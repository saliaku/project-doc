User profiling refers to the process of building a detailed cognitive and behavioral profile of each student based on a variety of learning-related metrics such as reading capabilities, working memory capacity, information processing abilities, and learning styles. These metrics serve as a foundation for tailoring the learning path

This approach enables a system to better understand how individual students absorb, process, and retain information, thereby creating the foundation for a personalized and adaptive learning experience.



## Reading Capabilities

The student’s reading capability is assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) metric. Students are asked to compose a short passage on a topic of choice. The FRE score of the submitted text is then calculated to evaluate their reading abilities.

## Working Memory Capacity

 Working memory capacity is evaluated using an N-back test. The assessment consists of a three-part N-back test involving visual, auditory, and textual stimuli. For each stimulus type, the student must identify whether the current item matches the one presented n trials earlier. We specifically employ the 2-back test.

 ## Information Processing

  Information processing ability is assessed using Bloom’s taxonomy, a cognitive framework comprising six levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. The assessment is divided into three sections based on the mode of information: visual, auditory, and textual.
