The proof of concept was implemented on Google Colab, with the complete code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sreeshu123/Final-year-project--GA). This prototype effectively demonstrates the validity of the proposed theory, confirming its practical feasibility and laying the groundwork for full-scale implementation. For a detailed understanding of the underlying theory, refer the [thesis](/Files/final_doc.pdf)
