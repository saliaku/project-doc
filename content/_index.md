Welcome to the documentation page of our final year project! This project centers on developing an adaptive e-learning framework tailored to support the diverse needs of neurodiverse learners. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it aims to offer personalized and inclusive learning experiences. The framework has been prototyped using Moodle, and this documentation is intended to guide others in replicating the system from setup to implementation.


## Key Features
- Personalized learning paths using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**
- Multimodal content delivery for varied learning styles
- Real-time feedback and adaptive learning

Our goal is to break traditional educational barriers and create an engaging, supportive, and accessible environment for all learners, regardless of their individual challenges. The proposed framework incorporates Genetic Algorithms to generate personalized lesson plans that align with each student's unique learning style. For a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, you can refer to the theoretical background of the framework [here](/Files/final_doc.pdf).
